# Common Pitfalls and Failure Modes of MMM Systems

This doc describes how MMM programs fail in practice and the design patterns that prevent instability, drift, and loss of trust.

## Failure mode: instability across refreshes
## Failure mode: silent data/pipeline drift
## Failure mode: identifiability and false certainty
## Failure mode: reporting that confuses rather than clarifies
## Failure mode: activation gaps (insights do not translate to decisions)
## Failure mode: governance gaps (no gates, no accountability)

## Patterns that prevent failure
## Practical checks and artifacts (what to implement)
