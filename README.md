# AI-Native MMM Patterns

Architecture patterns for AI-native Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) systems — focused on stability, Bayesian design principles, and non-proprietary measurement insights.

This repository documents how MMM systems should be designed in the AI era: resilient across refreshes, interpretable for decision-making, and grounded in sound system architecture rather than ad hoc modeling.

## Scope and Principles

- Tool-, vendor-, and company-agnostic  
- Focused on system design, not implementation details  
- Written from a product and architecture perspective  
- Safe to share publicly (no proprietary data or internal systems)

This is a living library intended for product leaders, data scientists, and analytics engineers building or evaluating modern measurement platforms.
