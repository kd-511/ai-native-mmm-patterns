# Activation and Governance

## Decision calendar (monthly/quarterly rhythm)
## Stakeholder roles (who decides, who reviews, who consumes)

## Standard outputs (what ships every refresh)
## Decision workflow (scenarios, recommendations, approvals)

## Governance gates (what requires signoff)
## Adoption metrics (usage, decision coverage, time-to-decision)
